**[Instant HDR-NeRF: Fast Learning of High Dynamic Range View Synthesis With Unknown Exposure Settings](https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/theses/2795/)**.  
Nam Nguyen  
Master's Thesis  
Advisor: Prof. Jonathan Ventura  
We introduce a method to a method of learning high dynamic range  view synthesis from a set of low dynamic range views with unknown and varying exposure and white balance in as little as minutes.

**[3D Pano Inpainting: Building a VR Environment from a Single Input Panorama](https://jonathanventura.github.io/3d-pano-inpainting/)**.   
Shivam Asija, Edward Du, Nam Nguyen, Stefanie Zollmann, and Jonathan Ventura  
IEEE VR 2024 Poster  
We propose a method to convert a 4K equirectangular panorama into a 3D mesh for real-time 6DOF view synthesis in VR headsets, with occluded regions inpainted by pretrained neural networks.
