I earned the B.S., and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo in 2023 and 2024, with my research work advised by Prof. [Jonathan Ventura](https://jonathanventura.github.io/). My research focus is 3D computer vision and deep learning. I am interested in building new technologies to make it easier for everyone to generate 3D assets from 2D images and videos. I have also been involved in different projects integrating deep learning into remote sensing applications.
