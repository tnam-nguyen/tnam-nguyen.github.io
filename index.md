👋 I am Nam Nguyen

🏫 A driven third year student completing the Blended BS + MS Computer Science Program at Cal Poly SLO (March 2024)

💻 I am passionate about using machine learning to solve interesting and meaningful image processing problems in the sciences, such as biology and geography. I am also interested in exploring the 3D world with different applications in augmented and virtual reality. 

💼 I am currently open to internship and research opportunities, especially in computer vision, AR/VR and machine learning. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to connect or chat!
